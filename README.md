# 🌍 Environmental Impact Dashboard with Power BI

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard designed for **ABC Environment**, a not-for-profit organization focused on global environmental sustainability. The dashboard provides actionable insights from open-source environmental datasets, enabling better decision-making, public transparency, and volunteer/donor engagement.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to support ABC Environment’s operations by visualizing:
- Global CO₂ emissions trends
- Country-wise emissions analysis
- Top emitters globally
- Global energy mix evolution (fossil, renewable, nuclear)

These visualizations help raise awareness, promote accountability, and support evidence-based climate action.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track environmental impact (e.g., CO₂ emissions)
- Support volunteer and donor analysis
- Visualize project performance metrics
- Encourage data-driven environmental decisions
- Promote public transparency and trust

---

## 📊 Power BI Visualizations

- **Line Chart**: Global CO₂ emissions from 1950 to 2022
- **Map Visual**: Country-wise CO₂ emissions (2022)
- **Bar Chart**: Top 10 CO₂ emitting countries
- **Stacked Area Chart**: Global energy mix (fossil, renewable, nuclear) over time

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** (Data transformation, DAX, visualization)
- Power Query (ETL)
- Datasets from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
- Excel for initial data cleaning

---

## 📚 Datasets Used

### 1. Global CO₂ Emissions
- Source: [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)
- Indicators: Total CO₂, per capita, fossil source types, GDP, population
- Coverage: 1750–2022, 200+ countries

### 2. Global Energy Mix
- Source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy)
- Indicators: Fossil, renewable, and nuclear energy shares
- Coverage: 1965–2023, 180+ countries

---

## 📌 Limitations

- Some missing data for specific countries or years
- Lack of fine-grained renewable energy type breakdown (e.g., solar vs wind)
- Focused on global trends over local NGO operations
